Ruby cheatsheets and mini projects.

Interactive REPL interface: `irb`.

As of 2013, Ruby is almost equivalent to Python (interpreted, dynamically typed)
and it is less used and not part of the LSB, so the only
reason to learn it is if you want to use a library which is written in it
such as the ubiquitous RoR. It is a shame that the FOSS community must be divided
yet again between those languages.
