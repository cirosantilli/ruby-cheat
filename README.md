## Sources

### De-facto official

-   <https://www.ruby-lang.org> Official website.

    There seems to be no Ruby Foundation analogous to the Python Foundation
    which is endorsed by the main author and holds copyright:
    <https://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/85675>.
    So we consider official anything endorsed (linked from) `ruby-lang.org`,
    which seems to be the most popular source.

-   <https://github.com/ruby/www.ruby-lang.org>

    Source code of `ruby-lang.org`.

-   <http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=59579>

    Ruby ISO spec. Not free.

-   <https://github.com/ruby/ruby>

    Official GitHub source code mirror. Includes stdlib.
    Takes pull requests, but does not merge them from there.

-   <http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/> Language built-ins docs.

-   <http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.1.3/> Stdlib docs.

-   <https://github.com/rubyspec/rubyspec>
    Executable specification for the Ruby language:
    tons of unit tests asserting it's behavior.

    Followed by several implementations.

### Third party

-   <http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/tutorial.html> Good intro tutorial.

-   <http://www.rubycentral.org/about> Organization that supports RubyConf and RailsConf.
